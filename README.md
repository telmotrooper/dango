## Installing

__Note:__ *You'll need a [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) instance running.*

* Clone this repository: `git clone git@github.com:telmotrooper/dango.git`
* Install the dependencies: `npm install`
* Copy the file `.env-example`, rename it to `.env` and fill it with the data to access your database. If you're running a local instance with default settings you'll probably only have to change the password setting (`DB_PASS`).
* To run the application, use: `npm start`
